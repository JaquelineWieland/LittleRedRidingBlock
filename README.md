My first Game I made as a Semesterproject in the University.
Programming Language: C#  
Framework: MonoGames
IDE: Visual Studio 2012


Little Red Riding Block is a 2D Jump´n´Run Game in which you take control over a little block-shaped character named Little Red Riding Block.
This sweet little Block is on her way to visit her sick Grandmother and bring her Flowers to cheer her up.

You have to get to your Grandmothers House hidden deep in the dark forest and bring her the flowers you have picked during your journey to her.

But be careful! 
Also a vicious wolf hunts in these woods. So don´t waste too much time to get to your Granny.
Otherwise the wolf might get you.
During your Journey through this odd and dangerous wood you might find a few strange but helpful items to help you on your way to Grannys House. 
You will find sweet little Cupcakes which will grant you a Speed Boost. Wine to give you a littlebit of extra time.
And Baskets to be able to carry more Flowers.

Each Flower you have gathered is worth 10 Points and every second you have left when you reach the Grandmothers House is also added to your score.
The Goal of the game is so reach the House in time and with the highest score.
